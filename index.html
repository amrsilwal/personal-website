<p>"Death is not a blotting-out of existence, a final escape from life; nor is death the door to immortality. He who has fled his Self in earthly joys will not recapture It amidst the gossamer charms of an astral world. There he merely accumulates finer perceptions and more sensitive responses to the beautiful and the good, which are one. It is on the anvil of this gross earth that struggling man must hammer out the imperishable gold of spiritual identity."</p><p>"Take life as it comes and death as it comes. Death is really beautiful; if it were a bad thing, God would not let it happen to us. It is really freedom, an entry into another, higher life. We must utilize this life in order to realize the life beyond this one. Beyond this earth garden is the infinite land wherein we meet those whom we have thought lost. Although we must not seek death, when it comes we should know that it is the final examination for a great reward."</p><p>- Pramahamsa Yogananda</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqHRkNhh6ibeGjxmXZvmwl7mM0ooE4J4wbUEOC-xGQ0oeXCrNehIxHE_Xfk8YevkCwv4C0f8zeHyHYTcHQQEiuBdgt5bGQWvpbxP0bYfWf5r1UY_lPFzBZFtcabSHhFebhCMuzwea_WYnGuaVFldkuVyjT6gPch5ml4K_fiBpj34UVuTg73ZGzX-eiiQ/s295/240905462_377665677262322_3990534952805896263_n.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="295" data-original-width="220" height="295" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqHRkNhh6ibeGjxmXZvmwl7mM0ooE4J4wbUEOC-xGQ0oeXCrNehIxHE_Xfk8YevkCwv4C0f8zeHyHYTcHQQEiuBdgt5bGQWvpbxP0bYfWf5r1UY_lPFzBZFtcabSHhFebhCMuzwea_WYnGuaVFldkuVyjT6gPch5ml4K_fiBpj34UVuTg73ZGzX-eiiQ/s1600/240905462_377665677262322_3990534952805896263_n.jpg" width="220" /></a></div><br /><p></p>
